This monorepo uses TypeScript Project References and tsc to build both JavaScript and declaration (.d.ts) files in projects

A project is any directory with both a package.json and a tsconfig.json, except the root directory

Turbo is used to orchestrate (package.json script) tasks across packages

The configuration is primarily in tsconfig (emitting JS and .d.ts files), and package.json exports fields, which are responsible for handing off types and modules to consuming projects:
- tsconfig: tools/tsconfig/*.json
- packages/**/package.json — exports and dev/build/check/format/lint scripts

Guidelines for automated suggestions:
- Do not modify any build-related configuration or tooling (including TypeScript, Turbo, update-ts-refs, Vite, etc.)
- Only suggest changes to TypeScript or Turbo configuration if strictly necessary—and never apply changes directly
- Do not modify or restructure anything related to the monorepo's build system, workspace layout, or tooling unless explicitly required to resolve a critical issue
- Focus suggestions strictly on relevant application-level logic, leaving infrastructure untouched unless absolutely unavoidable
