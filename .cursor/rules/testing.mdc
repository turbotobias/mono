# Test-Driven Rules

## Flow
1. Write tests ➜ code ➜ iterate until green.
2. Unit-test every conceivable input/output path.
3. Place *.test.ts[x] beside target file.
4. Extend existing test files first.

## Testing

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "bun:test"
```

## Other
- Config via bunfig.toml / setup.ts.
- DB/integration tests only on explicit request.

## Coverage
- Core behaviour
- Every utility function
- All edge cases you can hit (not third-party libs).
